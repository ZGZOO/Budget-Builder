Project Description
Budgeting is an essential life skill that is rarely taught in schools. Why not build software to help? This application makes up for users’ lack of knowledge regarding systemized spending and creates a budget plan as an overspending protector and a piggy bank that fits their income and expenditure situation.  

Project Functionalities
User will have his/her own accounts/profiles with a unique username and password.
User will enter information such as his/her name, the current month, income, spending categories and saving goal. 
The application will generate a personal budget plan for the user with a graph of percentage distribution of the spending categories and deposit. Maybe a pie chart, or a bar chart, or just a table.
The user can edit his/her income, spending categories and saving goal.
The Budget Builder will allow the user to input “test” amounts and see how it would affect their savings. Also the program can fill in categories defined by the user where a spending estimate is desired and a savings goal is known. E.g., if a user wants to know how much money they can spend on health insurance, the program would take their profile into account and output a max spending amount on health insurance. This output will be displayed to the user in an understandable visual, that would show the spending category in question, among the provided spending profile. Additionally, users will be able to come back to a previously built profile and edit it for any financial changes that have occurred, thus eliminating the need to repeat the profile creation process.

Our GOALS 
Implement at least three Object Oriented Design Patterns. (MVC,Observer, Iterator,etc)
Design user-friendly UI such as displaying the Graph for spendings and savings.
Save user information in a database.
Design a prototype: either drawing by hand on paper or digital graphings.
Assign team members with different project classes to implement.
Set up a plan with tasks to finish by each deadline.
